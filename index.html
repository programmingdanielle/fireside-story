        <p>It was a dark and stormy night....
            The poor overworked coder was totally lost and trying to complete a project while his coworkers partied hard.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, a dragon appears, towering over the poor overworked coworker.</p>
            <p>The dragon poses and them announces "I am the great coder extraordinare bow and worship me".</p>
            <p>Letting loose a mighty roar, the dragon's jowls parted to let loose a volatile wave of flame.
                From the blazing tornado materialized a portal, acting as a window into a separate universe.  
            </p>
            <p>"Enter the portal to gain knowledge of all things code," the beast said.</p>
